### Welcome!  

If you've managed to stumble across this blog it means you share an interest in all things machine learning, deep learning, and software engineering just like I do! Feedback is always welcome on any of the content I post.

### Background & Bio

I was born in Texas, but I grew up in Wisconsin. I relocated to Phoenix area in 2011, but I currently live in Scottsdale with my wife and two kids. We enjoy spending as much time outdoors as possible when the weather permits. It took me quite a while to figure out what I wanted to do with my life, but I really feel like I've zeroed in on a career that I find enjoyable and challenging.
